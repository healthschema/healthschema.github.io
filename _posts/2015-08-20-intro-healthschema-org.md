### Welcome to the Structured Data Web
The Internet is evolving from a Web of Documents to a Web of Data, driving the next generation of smarter, data-driven web applications and providing richer integration of data and services for and by end users of the web.  

Web crawlers, search engines, and web agents all seek and understand the structured data within web pages, and add much value to this  through automated computation and linkage of this data with other (structured data) sources.

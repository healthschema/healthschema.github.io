The Internet is evolving from a Web of Documents to a Web of Data, driving the next generation of smarter, data-driven web applications and providing richer integration of data and services for and by end users of the web.  

Web crawlers, search engines, and web agents all seek and understand the structured data within web pages, and add much value to this  through automated computation and linkage of this data with other (structured data) sources. 

End users of the web also expect structured data within the websites they visit, and expect intelligent automated processing of this. An analysis of 40 million primary level domains (PLDs) containing 3 billion HTML web pages shows a significant correlation of website ranking (number of visitors)  with the percentage of structure data it contains:

Top Ranked Sites |  PLDs in CC | # % AL |  % containing structured data | overall RDFa |  Microdata | Microformats
100     | 99        |  99.00 | 74.75    | 34.34   | 55.56   | 68.69
1k      | 963       |  96.30 | 62.62    | 40.08   |  31.67  | 46.11
10k     |  9,294    |  92.94 |  47.34   | 30.47   | 15.55   | 29.75
100k    |  85,058   |  85.01 |  31.94   | 16.46   |  7.20   | 20.07
1m      |  734,882  |  73.49 |  20.56   |  7.55   | 3.04    | 14.18


The bottom line is if you want your content to be discoverable, indexable, computable, reusable, or inter-linkable on the web - and to maximize its secondary use - you'll want to publish your content as structured data on the web.

Introduction to HealthSchema.org
-----

Trillions of searches into production, Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft have proven the value of structured data on the web using Schema.org.

Health data should also be first class citizen on world-wide information highway called the Internet of Data, and share a common universally accessible web-based health schema that is free and open for all to use, to create an Internet of Health Data.  

**Health data remains locked behind  tens of thousands of unique schemas from each source system** making health data unsharable, unqueryable, and unusable.

Health data is not special. Whether it is a recipe a medication, they are both well defined substances consumed by patients with well defined ingredients,and patients need to be able to find this information on the web.

HealthSchema.org is not a new health data standard. It is the same proven approach of Schema.org of the Internet of Data.


Welcome to healthschema.org.


Stay tuned...

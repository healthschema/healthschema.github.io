Introduction to HealthSchema.org
-----

Schema.org has demonstrated that people want data from the Internet, not just web pages.  Trillions of searches into production, Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft have proven the value of structured data on the web using Schema.org.

We believe health data should be first class citizen on world-wide information infrastructure on the Internet of Data, and share a common web-based health schema that is free and open for all to use, to create an Internet of Health Data.  

**Health data remains hidden and locked behind  tens of thousands of unique proprietary schemas of each source system** making health data unsharable, unqueryable, and unusable.

HealthSchema.org is not a new health data standard. it is simply leveraging the proven medium of the Internet of Data for heath data, just like Google represents everyday things with Schema.org,   so too can health data live in this same Internet of Data medidum.

Welcome to healthschema.org.


Stay tuned...

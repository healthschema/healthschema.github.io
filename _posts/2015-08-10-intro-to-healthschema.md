Introduction to HealthSchema.org
-----

What about Healthcare data standards? Unlike the schema.org approach of using an exposed universally web-accessible schema to support structured data across the Internet, **health data remains hidden and locked behind  tens of thousands of unique proprietary schemas of each source system** making health data unsharable, unqueryable, and unusable.

We also believe health data should be first class citizen on world-wide information infrastructure on the Internet of Data, and share a common web-based health schema that is free and open for all to use, to create an Internet of Health Data.


Welcome to healthschema.org.


Stay tuned...

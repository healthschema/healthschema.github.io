title: Not Another Healthcare Standard

The Healthcare Data Standards Industry
-----

**Health Data Standards is a Business, not a Solution**

**First**, healthcare data standards are *designed by committees* behind *closed doors* by special "experts" (either "Academics" or "Self-appointed Wizards") rather than by the millions of consumers of this data. The process or creating standards is not based on empirical or scientific data of usage by doctors and patients (the kinds of information search engine companies have).  As a result these vocabularies and models bloat out of control with irrelevant complexity, catering to only the long tail and of special and academic interests, and not for the basic needs of the masses. This assures the central role and job security of "the experts"  in continued management of these standards.

**Second**, all health data standards organization have different agendas, goals, and procedures they need to support, not least of which is to monetize their special standard to assure organizational sustainability.  

**Third**, many of these organizations have been in sustainment mode for over three decades.  In information science timescales, their standards are dinsaurs, pre-dating the existence of the Internet (and its vast, dynamic, real-time information network) as the primary distribution channel for data.  Information is not controlled by "special" people and organizations anymore. Everyone has a voice on the Internet now. 

**Fourth**, each healthcare data standard is its own silo, with

* different release schedules  (weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, or once a decade)
* different and proprietary formats (dating over 25 years old)
* different and proprietary licenses (none of them freely usable or creative commmons)
* different and proprietary models
* different payment models and paywalls
* different, ambigous and conflicting defintions.

**Fifth**,it is technically *impossible* to implement the current HIT standards in any consistent fashion across healthcare systems, because not only are they inconsistent, but they are continuously changing - all on differet intervals.


**In summary, it is the persistence of legacy healthcare data standards that remain the fundamental problem for health data management.**  Health Information Technology (HIT) product vendors support this state of legacy HIT standards because it provides them top cover: "We use HIT standard XYZ... therefore we must be interoperable!" while remaining completely silo'd because every one of these standards is completely and utterly implementation-specific.  The HIT Systems Integrators and  Consultants support the status quo, since it provides them a never-ending and lucrative supply of complex, costly data integration contracts.

There is nothing new in the current landscape of HIT standards.  Only re-packaging of legacy standards, not unlike a plumber putting gold foil on clogged and leaking lead pipes and exlaiming "Look! A brand new (data) plumbing system!". And then the customer complains "but my (data) pipes are still leaking and clogged".


**Why do we have such a proliferation of different "healthare-data-is-special" standards in the first place?
Does this mean that healthcare data is categorically different from any other kind of data?**


Why we need HealthSchema.org

**Healthcare data is not special.**  It does not require special containers, formats, structures, or packaging. It is just data.  And it must be available universally and freely to the people it ultimately belongs to, the patients, in a form they canconsume with their normal Internet devices.

If we can represent ingredients for a recipe in structured form in machine-processable form unambiguously on the Internet, we can also represent a medication list or problem list.

Introduction to Schema.org
-----

Everything on the Internet starts with Search. 

**Google Guess**. A Google search used to be based on satistical page ranks and keyword matches, and generating hundreds of thousands of results per search. Google had no understanding of the intent of the search, the meaning of the search terms, nor the meaning of the statistically generated list of results.  It was up to the individual to sift through the results.

**Google Know**. To support next generation of smart, actionable, semantic search (where the meaning and intent of the search is understood, leading to specific useful actions on the data) the Internet search giants (Google, Yahoo, Microsoft,...) adopted a common, open, and universally accessible schema ( [schema.org](http://schema.org/) )to provide clear, unambigous structure and definition for information on the Internet.  

Over a trillion web searches each year now flow through Schema.org to provide exact, meaningful results directly to the information intended. In its role providing meaning (semantics) to structured data on the web, Schema.org provides content managers with machine-actionable data, moving us closer to the next generation Internet - the Internet of Data.

Schema.org has [many schemas](http://schema.org/docs/schemas.html) for data, both general-purpose (demographics) and concrete (restaurant).

But what about Healthcare data? Why is it so hard to share across the Internet?  Unlike the above approach of using a single universally accessible schema to support structured data across the Internet, **health data remains hidden and locked behind  tens of thousands of unique proprietary schemas of each source system** making health data unsharable, unqueryable, and unusable.


The Healthcare Data Standards Industry
-----

**Health Data Standards is a Business, not a Solution**

**First**, healthcare data standards are designed by committees of special experts behind closed doors ("Academics" or Wizards") rather than by the millions of consumers of this data. The process or creating standards is not based on empirical or scientific data of usage by doctors and patients (the kinds of information search engine companies have).  As a result these vocabularies and models bloat out of control with irrelevant complexity, catering to special interests.  This assures the central role and job security of "the experts"  in continued management of these standards.

**Second**, all health data standards organization have different agendas, goals, and procedures they need to support, not least of which is to monetize their special standard to assure organizational sustainability.  

**Third**, many of these organizations have been in sustainment mode for over three decades.  In information science timescales, their standards are dinsaurs, predating the existence of the Internet (and its vast, dynamic, real-time information network) as the primary distribution channel for information.  Information is not controlled by "special" people and organizations anymore. Everyone has a voice on the Internet now. 

**Fourth**, each healthcare data standard is its own silo, with
* different release schedules  (weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, or once a decade)
* different and proprietary formats (dating over 25 years old)
* different and proprietary licenses (none of them freely usable or creative commmons)
* different and proprietary models
* different payment models
* different, ambigous and conflicting defintions.

And of course, fundamentally different and incompatible schemes.

**The persistence of legacy healthcare data standards remains a fundamental problem.**  Health IT product vendors support this state of legacy health IT standards because it provides top cover to claim "We use HIT standard XYZ... therefore we must be interoperable!" while remaining completely silo'd.  The HIT Systems Integrators and  Consultants support the status quo, since it provides them a never-ending supply of complex, expensive data integration contracts. There is nothing new in the current iteration of shiny packaging of legacy tools. 


**This begs the question: Is healthcare data categorically different from any other kind of data?**


HealthSchema.org
-----

**Healthcare data is not special.**  It must be available for management by normal people, like patients.  It does not require special containers and formats.  If we can represent ingredients for a recipe structure unambiguously on the Internet, we can also represent a medication list!


On healthschema.org, we think health data shoud be first class citizen on the open, world-wide information infrastructure that we call the Internet.


Stay tuned...

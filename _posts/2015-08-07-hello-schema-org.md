title: Schema.org Introduction
---

The world's internet search engines (Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft, ...)  rely on a single common [schema.org](http://schema.org/) to provide the structure and definition for all information searched and processed on the web.

Schema.org has [many schemas](http://schema.org/docs/schemas.html) for data, both general-purpose (demographics ...) and concrete (restaurant). 

But what about Healthcare?  

It remains silo'd in "healthcare-data-is-oh-so-special" silos.

On healthschema.org, heath data can also become an equal citizen on the internet of structured data.

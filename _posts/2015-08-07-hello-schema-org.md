title: Schema.org:  A Model for Health Data too
---


Introduction to Schema.org
-----

The Internet is the largest data resource known to man, and is capable of storing 2^128, or 10^38 bytes of data.  For reference, the largest Big Data datbases are only petabyte scale (10^15 bytes), making the Internet 10^20 orders of magnitue larger.  So how do we find things on the Internet?

**Google Guess**. Google search used to be based on satistical page ranks and keyword matches, generating hundreds of thousands of results per search. Google had no understanding of the meaning of the search terms, the intent of the search, nor the meaning of the statistically generated output of results.  It was up to the individual to sift through the results.

**Google Know**.  Today Google provides smarter search (semantic search - where the meaning and intent of the search is understood, leading to specific useful actions on the data).  To accomplish this, the Internet search giants (Google, Yahoo, Microsoft,...) adopted a single, common, open, and universally accessible schema ( [schema.org](http://schema.org/) )to provide clear, unambigous structure and definition for information content on the Internet.  

Today a trillion web searches each year flow leverage Schema.org to provide precise, meaningful results directly to the information resource intended, and to provide machine-processable data on the web, allowing actions such as automated hotel bookings, automated airline check-in,  or automated reminders of appointments via your mobile phone.  By providing meaning (semantics) to structured data on the web, Schema.org moves us closer to the next generation Internet:  the Internet of (Machine-understandable and processable structured) Data.

Schema.org has [many schemas](http://schema.org/docs/schemas.html) for data, both general-purpose (demographics) and concrete (restaurant).

But what about Healthcare data? Unlike the above approach of using an exposed universally web-accessible schema to support structured data across the Internet, **health data remains hidden and locked behind  tens of thousands of unique proprietary schemas of each source system** making health data unsharable, unqueryable, and unusable.


The Healthcare Data Standards Industry
-----

**Health Data Standards is a Business, not a Solution**

**First**, healthcare data standards are designed by committees of special experts behind closed doors ("Academics" or Wizards") rather than by the millions of consumers of this data. The process or creating standards is not based on empirical or scientific data of usage by doctors and patients (the kinds of information search engine companies have).  As a result these vocabularies and models bloat out of control with irrelevant complexity, catering to special interests.  This assures the central role and job security of "the experts"  in continued management of these standards.

**Second**, all health data standards organization have different agendas, goals, and procedures they need to support, not least of which is to monetize their special standard to assure organizational sustainability.  

**Third**, many of these organizations have been in sustainment mode for over three decades.  In information science timescales, their standards are dinsaurs, predating the existence of the Internet (and its vast, dynamic, real-time information network) as the primary distribution channel for information.  Information is not controlled by "special" people and organizations anymore. Everyone has a voice on the Internet now. 

**Fourth**, each healthcare data standard is its own silo, with
* different release schedules  (weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, or once a decade)
* different and proprietary formats (dating over 25 years old)
* different and proprietary licenses (none of them freely usable or creative commmons)
* different and proprietary models
* different payment models
* different, ambigous and conflicting defintions.

And of course, fundamentally different and incompatible schemes.

**The persistence of legacy healthcare data standards remains a fundamental problem.**  Health IT product vendors support this state of legacy health IT standards because it provides top cover to claim "We use HIT standard XYZ... therefore we must be interoperable!" while remaining completely silo'd.  The HIT Systems Integrators and  Consultants support the status quo, since it provides them a never-ending supply of complex, expensive data integration contracts. There is nothing new in the current iteration of shiny packaging of legacy tools. 


**This begs the question: Is healthcare data categorically different from any other kind of data?**


Introduction to HealthSchema.org
-----

**Healthcare data is not special.**  It must be available for management by normal people, like patients.  It does not require special containers and formats.  If we can represent ingredients for a recipe structure unambiguously on the Internet, we can also represent a medication list!


On healthschema.org, we think health data shoud be first class citizen on the open, world-wide information infrastructure that we call the Internet.


Stay tuned...

Introduction to Schema.org

**The Internet is vast.  Semantic Search changes this.**

The Internet protocol allows one to access information through a world wide network of 10^38 universal resource locators (URLs). If each resource represented only one byte of data (rather than a web page), this would represent a database of 10^38 bytes. A petabyte is 10^15 bytes, and is the scale of the worlds largest 'Big Data' warehouses managed by Amazon, WalMart, and Google.  The Internet therefore represents a database 10^23 times larger than any single data repository built by man. How can we leverage the Internet as a database? And how how can one search or process such a vast network of distributed data?

**Google Guess**. Google search used to be based on satistical page ranks and keyword matches, generating hundreds of thousands of results per search. Google had no understanding of the meaning of the search terms, the intent of the search, nor the meaning of the statistically generated output of results.  It was up to the individual to sift through the results.

**Google Know**.  Today Google provides "smart" search (i.e. semantic search - where the meaning and intent of the search is understood, leading to specific useful actions on the data).  To accomplish this, the Internet search giants (Google, Yahoo, Microsoft,...) adopted a single, common, open, and universally accessible schema ( [schema.org](http://schema.org/) )to provide clear, unambigous structure and definition for information content on the Internet.  

Today a trillion web searches each year leverage Schema.org to provide precise, meaningful results directly to the information resource intended on the web, and to provide machine-processable data on the web, allowing actions such as automated hotel bookings, automated airline check-in,  or automated reminders of appointments via your mobile phone.  By providing meaning (semantics) to structured data on the web, Schema.org moves us closer to the next generation Internet:  the Internet of Data. More precisely, the Internet of semantically interlinked machine-processable Data.

Schema.org has [many schemas](http://schema.org/docs/schemas.html) for data, both general-purpose (demographics) and concrete (restaurant).

Introduction to Schema.org
-----

The world's largest single database projects are on the petabyte scale (10^15 bytes). The Internet protocol, on the other hand, allows one to access information through a world wide network of 10^38 bytes - over 20 orders of magnitude larger.  So how can one search the Internet?

**Google Guess**. Google search used to be based on satistical page ranks and keyword matches, generating hundreds of thousands of results per search. Google had no understanding of the meaning of the search terms, the intent of the search, nor the meaning of the statistically generated output of results.  It was up to the individual to sift through the results.

**Google Know**.  Today Google provides "smart" search (i.e. semantic search - where the meaning and intent of the search is understood, leading to specific useful actions on the data).  To accomplish this, the Internet search giants (Google, Yahoo, Microsoft,...) adopted a single, common, open, and universally accessible schema ( [schema.org](http://schema.org/) )to provide clear, unambigous structure and definition for information content on the Internet.  

Today a trillion web searches each year leverage Schema.org to provide precise, meaningful results directly to the information resource intended on the web, and to provide machine-processable data on the web, allowing actions such as automated hotel bookings, automated airline check-in,  or automated reminders of appointments via your mobile phone.  By providing meaning (semantics) to structured data on the web, Schema.org moves us closer to the next generation Internet:  the Internet of (Machine-understandable and processable) Data.

Schema.org has [many schemas](http://schema.org/docs/schemas.html) for data, both general-purpose (demographics) and concrete (restaurant).

But what about Healthcare data? Unlike the above approach of using an exposed universally web-accessible schema to support structured data across the Internet, **health data remains hidden and locked behind  tens of thousands of unique proprietary schemas of each source system** making health data unsharable, unqueryable, and unusable.


The Healthcare Data Standards Industry
-----

**Health Data Standards is a Business, not a Solution**

**First**, healthcare data standards are designed by committees of special experts behind closed doors ("Academics" or Wizards") rather than by the millions of consumers of this data. The process or creating standards is not based on empirical or scientific data of usage by doctors and patients (the kinds of information search engine companies have).  As a result these vocabularies and models bloat out of control with irrelevant complexity, catering to only the long tail and whims of special interests, and not for the basic needs of the masses. This assures the central role and job security of "the experts"  in continued management of these standards.

**Second**, all health data standards organization have different agendas, goals, and procedures they need to support, not least of which is to monetize their special standard to assure organizational sustainability.  

**Third**, many of these organizations have been in sustainment mode for over three decades.  In information science timescales, their standards are dinsaurs, pre-dating the existence of the Internet (and its vast, dynamic, real-time information network) as the primary distribution channel for data.  Information is not controlled by "special" people and organizations anymore. Everyone has a voice on the Internet now. 

**Fourth**, each healthcare data standard is its own silo, with

* different release schedules  (weekly, monthly, quarterly, annually, or once a decade)
* different and proprietary formats (dating over 25 years old)
* different and proprietary licenses (none of them freely usable or creative commmons)
* different and proprietary models
* different payment models and paywalls
* different, ambigous and conflicting defintions.

**Fifth**, each it is technically impossible to implement the myriad HIT standards in any consistent fashion, because not only are they inconsistent, but also continuously changing - all at differet intervals. 


**In summary, it is the persistence of legacy healthcare data standards the remains a fundamental problem in HIT.**  Health Information Technology (HIT) product vendors support this state of legacy HIT standards because it provides them top cover: "We use HIT standard XYZ... therefore we must be interoperable!" while remaining completely silo'd because every one of these standards is completely and utterly implementation-specific.  The HIT Systems Integrators and  Consultants support the status quo, since it provides them a never-ending and lucrative supply of complex, costly data integration contracts.

There is nothing new in the current landscape of HIT standards.  Only re-packaging of legacy standards, not unlike a plumber putting gold foil on clogged and leaking lead pipes and exlaiming "Look!  Brand new plumbing system!". And then the customer complains "but my pipes are still leaking and clogged".


**This begs the question: Is healthcare data categorically different from any other kind of data?**


Introduction to HealthSchema.org
-----

**Healthcare data is not special.**  It must be available for management by normal people, like patients.  It does not require special containers and formats.  If we can represent ingredients for a recipe structure unambiguously on the Internet, we can also represent a medication list!


On healthschema.org, we think health data shoud be first class citizen on the open, world-wide information infrastructure that we call the Internet.


Stay tuned...

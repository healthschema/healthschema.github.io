title: Introducing schema.org

On healthschema.org, we make pie and eat it and walk our dogs too.

[schema.org](http://schema.org/) has [many schemas](http://schema.org/docs/schemas.html) for data both general-purpose (demographics ...) and concrete (restaurant). Google uses it ... but what about Healthcare?

Thanks!

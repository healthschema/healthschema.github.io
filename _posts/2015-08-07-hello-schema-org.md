---

All internet search engines (Google, Yahoo, Microsoft,...) use a common schema [schema.org](http://schema.org/) to provide the common structure and definition for all information searched and processed on the web today.

Schema.org has [many schemas](http://schema.org/docs/schemas.html) for data, both general-purpose (demographics ...) and concrete (restaurant).
